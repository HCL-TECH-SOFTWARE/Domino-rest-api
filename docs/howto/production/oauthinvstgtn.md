# Investigate OAuth

## About this task

Guides you into OAuth authentication to use Domino REST API using [Bruno](../../references/usertools/bruno.md).

## Before you begin

- You have installed **Bruno**.

    Bruno is available as a native desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux. For more information, see [Download Bruno's Desktop Application](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/download "Opens a new tab"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;![link image](../../assets/images/external-link.svg){: style="height:15px;width:15px"}.

- Take note of the *Environment variables*.

    In the APIs used in the OAuth investigation, you will see fields surrounded by double brackets like `{{OAUTHHOST}}` or `{{AdminName}}`. These fields represent user inputs and should generally not be hard coded. You can use the following as reference:

    ```
    vars {
      AdminName: John Doe
      OAUTHHOST: http://localhost:8880
      state: someRandomValue
    }
    vars:secret [
      AdminPassword
    ] 
    ```
