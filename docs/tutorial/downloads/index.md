## Command line utilities

Put the command line utilities somewhere on your path. On Linux/macOS, that's typically `~/bin`. On Windows, you can create `~\cmd` and add it to the path.

- [Keep shell script](keep) (Linux / macOS)
- [Keep.cmd](keep.cmd) (Windows)
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)

On Linux/macOS, when it isn't already available, you can use your packet manager:

- `brew install curl` (macOS)
- `sudo dnf install curl` (Redhat/Centos)
- `sudo apt install curl` (Debian/Ubuntu)
