## Run Domino REST API with a Docker image

The Domino REST API Docker image is built **on top of an HCL Domino Docker image**, inspired by [the open source templates](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/domino-container).
All configuration options found there can be applied to the Domino REST API Docker image. You will need to decide if you want to run a standalone server or an additional server in an existing Domino domain.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip
    The Domino REST API Docker image **contains** a Domino server. You don't need a separate Domino installation. The image is completely self contained. Domino REST API is a Domino service, using the network free C API. So there is no scenario where an "only Domino REST API" container would work.

## Prerequisites

Running Domino REST API with a Docker image requires the following:

- **[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**. A Docker installation, both **Docker** (for servers) or **Docker Desktop** are suitable. Download and install **Docker Desktop** for your environment (Linux, Windows or macOS).
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**. When you install a Docker Desktop version (Windows, macOS), Docker compose is already included.
  For servers, it's an [additional install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Login to HCL's instance of **[FlexNet](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/)** using your credentials and download the [Domino REST API Docker image](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/entitledDownloadFile.action?downloadPkgId=HCL_Domino_REST_API_EAP) as an archive file.

    !!!tip
        This prerequisite is only needed if you would use the docker image from **FlexNet**. If you would use the docker image from [HCL Container Repository (Harbor)](https://hclcr.io/){: target="_blank"}, you just need to take note of the image name of the latest docker image version for docker compose .env file from Harbor indicated in [What's New](../../references/whatisnew.md).

- A valid **Domino server id**, when you want to run as additional server in your existing domain.
- A **Docker compose file** from [Downloadable resources](../../references/downloads.md). Select the matching one for either a standalone primary or an additional server.
- A **`.env` file**. Download the `sample.env` from [Downloadable resources](../../references/downloads.md). **Rename the file to `.env`**, and **update** the `.env` file with your values.

!!! tip "Docker Desktop License"
    Docker desktop [recently](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/31/docker_desktop_no_longer_free/) became subject to a [Docker subscription](https://www.docker.com/pricing), make sure you are compliant or use the command line.

### Getting Ready

A Domino server uses one persistent volume to store its data. This volume also stores log files and the serverâ€™s ID file. When you remove the container that volume remains and is reused when you start a new container instance.

![Docker Consumption](../../assets/images/DominoKeepContainers.png)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note

    When you want to run multiple servers, create separate volumes for each. DO NOT share volumes between running instances.

## Store the following files in a folder:

- **server id**. Make sure that your server id file is named `server.id`.
- **docker-compose.yml**. Rename the compose file you downloaded from [resources](../../references/downloads.md) to `docker-compose.yml`.
- **.env** . Edit the `.env` file from [resources](../../references/downloads.md) to update your values. You need to replace all values after the equal (`=`) sign.

You can configure multiple Domino servers in a single compose file. For details, check the [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) documentation. Domino REST API in mind, each server needs its own volume.

**For docker image from FlexNet**

Load the docker image that you've downloaded from [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above. Make sure you [extract the tar.gz file](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-gz-file/) first. 

```bash
docker load -i [name_of_tar_file].tar
```

After loading the image, note the image name that got installed. This image name is needed to update the `CONTAINER_IMAGE` variable described below.

Example loaded image:

```bash
Loaded image: docker.qs.hcllabs.net/hclcom/projectkeep-r12:1.10.0
```

**For docker image from HCL Container Repository (Harbor)**

Take note of the image name of the latest docker image version for docker compose .env file from Harbor indicated in [What's New](../../references/whatisnew.md). This image name is needed to update the `CONTAINER_IMAGE` variable described below.

Example image name:

```bash
hclcr.io/domino/restapi:1.0.6
```
### Table of variables

Depending on the compose file you choose, a different set of variables needs to be replaced. If a variable isn't in the compose file, you don't need it. We keep the variable names in sync with [One-touch Domino setup](https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/12.0.0/admin/wn_one-touch_domino_setup.html), thus in the compose file you will find gems like `SERVERSETUP_SERVER_NAME: "${SERVERSETUP_SERVER_NAME}"`. This makes naming of variables consistent.

Refer also to the official [List of One-touch environment variables](https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/12.0.0/admin/inst_onetouch_preparing_sysenv.html) for reference.

## Run Domino REST API

Start Domino REST API using `docker-compose` on all supported platforms:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note

    - Start in the directory where the files `server.id` and `docker-compose.yml` are located.
    - The setup can take a few minutes, depending on your hardware and the network speed to your primary server.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip

    **When you don't have DNS setup**, amend your `hosts` file for name resolution:

    - `/etc/hosts` on Linux or macOS
    - `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows

- You can then use Docker desktop to start/stop the container.
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to run docker in the background.
- Don't run two Domino REST API containers sharing the same volume at the same time, alternate (e.g. debug/non-debug) or with 2 different volumes is OK.

## Validation

To validate that an instance is successfully running on a container:

- A docker container should be created and running on your docker machine. To check that the container is up, issue this command on a terminal:

```bash
docker ps
```

- The container should be accessible via

```bash
docker exec -it $containername /bin/bash
```

- Domino should be accessible on `http://$host:80` (might need configuration).
- Domino REST API should be accessible on `http://$host:8880`.
- Domino REST API Management should be accessible on `http://$host:8889`.
- Metrics should be accessible on `http://$host:8890/metrics`.

## Alternate Docker configuration

When you run your Domino servers on Linux, you probably use the [Nashcom startup script](https://www.nashcom.de/nshweb/pages/startscript.htm) for Domino.
On this foundation, the GitHub.com hosted [Domino Docker](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/domino-container) project offers management scripts that allows easy management of your Docker container using a command `domino_container`.

Installation steps are as follows:

1. Clone the [domino-docker](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/domino-container) repository: `git clone https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/domino-container`
2. Change into the installations directory: `cd start_script`
3. Run the installer: `./install_domino_container` 

    !!!note
        You might need `sudo` to run the installer.

Now you have the command `domino_container` at your disposal:

- Use `domino_container cfg` to set your configuration.
- Use `domino_container env` for the environment values.
- Start Domino and Domino REST API using `domino_container start`.
- Learn more about the scripts using `domino_container help`.
