# Domino REST API Walkthrough

This workshop is designed for a duration of 3.5 h (210 min) and covers the use and configuration of the Domino REST API using:

- Command line
- POSTMAN (or your favorite REST client)
- Domino REST AdminUI
- Code examples

## Agenda

See the menu on the left for the sequence.

## Prerequisites

- a running Domino server with the Domino REST API installed:
    - on your local machine
    - a remote server (note: you need OS access there)
    - in a virtual machine
    - in a (Docker) container using the the Domino REST API Container image
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) installed
- [CURL](https://curl.se) installed
- An IDE, like Eclipse or Visual Studio Code, installed
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS Version) if you want to complete the JavaScript exercises
- [JDK](https://jdk.java.net) (>= 8) if you want to complete the Java exercises
- Internet connection
- Optional (but you want out of curiosity): Domino Designer installed

!!!danger "Don't use a production server"
    We will mess with settings, so you don't want to work on a production system. A temporary local server will do.

### Skills

- Understanding of Domino
- Understanding of Containers (optional)
- Understanding what an API is
- Ability to use the command line (preferably with `curl`)
- for the code exercises:
    - experience in Java programming
    - experience with JavaScript and NodeJS

<!--## Conduct

- ask questions
