# Domino REST API walkthrough

## Overview

The walkthrough guides you step-by-step on using and configuring the Domino REST API using:

- Command line
- Postman
- Domino REST API Admin UI
- code examples

## Objective

- Understand how to use the Domino REST API via different interfaces.
- Learn the configuration of Domino REST API.
- Gain hands-on experience through code exercises.

## Before you begin

Before starting, make sure that you meet the listed prerequisites and skills requirement.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following setup:

- A running Domino server with the Domino REST API installed. This can be:
    - On your local machine
    - On a remote server (must have OS access)
    - Inside a virtual machine
    - Inside a Docker container running Domino REST API container image
- Postman installed for API testing.
- curl installed for command-line API calls.
- An IDE, such as Eclipse or Visual Studio Code, is installed for coding exercises.
- Node.js (LTS version) for JavaScript exercises.
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher) for Java exercises.
- Reliable internet connection.
- (Optional) Domino Designer if interested in exploring further.

!!! danger "Important"

    **Don't use** a production server for this walkthrough as configuration changes will be made. It is recommended to use a temporary local server.

### Skills required

- Basic understanding of Domino.
- Familiarity with Containers (optional).
- Basic API concepts.
- Ability to use the command line, preferably with curl.
- For coding exercises, knowledge of Java programming, JavaScript, and Node.js.

## Next step

Proceed to [Lab 0 - Overview](lab-00.md).

<!--
This workshop is designed for a duration of 3.5 h (210 min) and covers the use and configuration of the Domino REST API using:

- Command line
- POSTMAN (or your favorite REST client)
- Domino REST Admin UI
- Code examples

## Agenda

See the menu on the left for the sequence.

## Prerequisites

- A running Domino server with the Domino REST API installed on one of the following:
    - on your local machine
    - a remote server (note: you need OS access there)
    - in a virtual machine
    - in a (Docker) container using the the Domino REST API Container image

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) installed

- [CURL](https://curl.se) installed
- An IDE, like Eclipse or Visual Studio Code, installed

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS Version) if you want to complete the JavaScript exercises

- [JDK](https://jdk.java.net) (>= 8) if you want to complete the Java exercises
- Internet connection
- Optional (but you want out of curiosity): Domino Designer installed

!!!danger "Don't use a production server"
    We will mess with settings, so you don't want to work on a production system. A temporary local server will do.

### Skills

- Understanding of Domino
- Understanding of Containers (optional)
- Understanding what an API is
- Ability to use the command line (preferably with `curl`)
- For the code exercises:
    - experience in Java programming
    - experience with JavaScript and NodeJS

## Conduct

- ask questions
- try things out
- talk to your fellow participants (a.k.a. pair-programming)-->
