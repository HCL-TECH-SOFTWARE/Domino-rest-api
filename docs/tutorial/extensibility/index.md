# Extensibility tutorial

The tutorial will walk you through the creation of a custom URL endpoint approving and rejecting generic request. You need to be familiar with Java and Domino to follow it.

## OpenAPI specification

First step is to create an OpenAPI 3.0.x specification. You can do that using notepad, but you want to use [available tooling](https://openapi.tools/#gui-editors). You could use the original [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/), Redhat's [Apicurio](https://www.apicur.io/) (Apicurito will suffice in most cases) or (what the creator of this tutorial liked best [APIGit](https://apigit.com/))

## Setting up the Maven Java project

Second step is to setup the Java project. It will use a published parent project and libraries installed with your DRAPI installation

## Creating the config.json

## Implementing business logic

## Access Control

## Deployment

## Setting up a devcontainer

This step is strictly optional. It can, after the initial setup steps greatly improve your developer experience by creating a well known development environment.
