# Form definitions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "Form item, not Form design element"
    Form definitions relate to "Documents that have a Form item with the given value", not "the Form design element with the given name". The [AdminUI](#) uses fields listed in Form design elements, so it is convenient to craete form definitions. At runtime no Form design element is used by the REST API
