- Increased speed of design element population in the Admin UI.
- Increased stability of the Admin UI when the retrieving complex databases.
- Added ability to view the Domino Server console live as well as send commands from the Domino REST API management page if using admin credentials. See [Domino Console Configuration](../installconfig/configuration/console.md) for more information.
- Added ability to send Domino Server console commands via API if using admin credentials.
- Added ability to view the schema json within the Admin UI.
- Added ability for customers to use a different name for fields (like an alias) in a schema,Â  good for obfuscating field names or for descriptive naming.
- <span style="color:red">The `setup-v1/design` json output been modified so the design element key is the UNID, previously the key was the design element name. This change was made because design element names are not necessarily unique and part of the fix for design element population noted above.</span>

              "@unid": "87A0390EA55C0D4C852567710005FF52",
              "@name": "ReportNotes",
              ...
  ```

- Docker image version for docker compose .env file (CONTAINER*IMAGE) is \_docker.qs.hcllabs.net/hclcom/projectkeep-r12:1.12.0*

## V1.0.1 - _What's new or changed_

- Resolved issues that could cause the Domino restapi task to not successfully start on Linux Domino.
- The installer now has an upgrade option. Please see the [installation instructions](../tutorial/installconfig/index.md) for more information.
- Added the `PATCH` verb to the APIs `/api/v1/document/{unid}` and `/api/v1/bulk/update` allowing a document update without the need to provide all fields in the schema.
- Resolved an issue that prevented a document from being created or updated if one of it's multi-value fields had empty value(s).
- Fixed multiple issues around odata.
- Quick Config option was added to the Admin UI (lightning bolt on the left side). This feature creates a populated Schema and Scope based on the database you choose.
  - The Schema is configured with all visible Forms and Views.
  - All non-system fields are added to the Forms.
- Field schema has been modified. The boolean fields `readOnly` and `writeOnly` were removed and replaced with String field `fieldAccess` which specifies the access of this field, either `RW`, `RO` or `WO`. If existing schemas have the old fields, they will be still processed correctly.
- `null` has been added as valid json for document updating, setting a field value to `null` will remove that field from the document.
- Inactive scopes will no longer show in the Swagger UI's drop down list since they are not available.
- Performance improvements.

## V1.0 - _What's changed since the Early Access Release_

- The `core` api (`/api/v1`) has changed name, it is now `basis`, but still has the same path (`/api/v1`).
- The `design`, `schema`, `scope` and some `administrative` APIs that were in the `core` api have been moved to the `setup` api (`/api/setup-v1`). This has been done so that these apis can be disabled from a user facing server.
- The Domino REST API landing page now has a single button for the Swagger UI, once in the Swagger UI, use the drop down at the top right to switch between API specifications.

## **HCL Domino REST API formerly known as HCL Project KEEP**

`HCL Project KEEP` was introduced as an Early Adopter program. We have re-branded `HCL Project KEEP` to `HCL Domino REST API` to align with our `HCL VOLT MX GO` strategy.
You will find that there are still references to the KEEP branding throughout the product and in the documentation. Please see the table at the [bottom of this page](#keep-branding-examples) to see those areas where the KEEP branding is still prevalent.
