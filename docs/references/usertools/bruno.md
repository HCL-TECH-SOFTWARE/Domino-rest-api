## Introduction

[Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/introduction/what-is-bruno "Opens a new tab"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;![link image](../../assets/images/external-link.svg){: style="height:15px;width:15px"} is an offline-first, open-source API client that improves collaboration by maintaining a live connection to your version control system, such as Git. With Bruno, collections are stored directly in a folder on your file system, and a plain text markup language called `Bru` saves information about API requests. Additionally, Bruno enhances data privacy and security since it operates offline. There is no concept of logging in or creating an account, and there is no cloud connection to sync your work in Bruno.

Bruno enables you to send authentication details with your API requests. You can set authentication methods at either the request level or the collection level, allowing all your requests to use the same method if desired. Authentication details can be included in the header, body, or as a parameter with any request in Bruno.

Bruno currently supports OAuth2 authentication.
