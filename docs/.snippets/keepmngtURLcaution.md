!!! warning "Caution"
    The `KeepManagementURL` setting in your `notes.ini` is the URL needed for the Domino REST API Domino task to talk to the Java side of Domino REST API. By default, this is set to `http`. If you have updated your security to `https`, you must update this URL. For more information, see [Domino REST API task](../references/usingdominorestapi/restapitask.md).
