The time zone to associate\n   with the LocalDateTime comes from the \"timeZone\" property of the\n   JSCalendar object (see Section 4.7.1).  If no time zone is specified,\n   the LocalDateTime is \"floating\".  Floating date-times are not tied to\n   any specific time zone.

When converting local\n   date-times that fall in the discontinuity to UTC, the offset before\n   the transition MUST be used.\n\n   For example, in the America/Los_Angeles time zone, the date-time\n   2020-11-01T01:30:00 occurs twice: before the DST transition with a\n   UTC offset of -07:00, and again after the transition with an offset\n   of -08:00.

However, such a value may appear\n   during calculations (see duration semantics in Section 1.4.6), or due\n   to a change in time zone rules (so it was valid when the event was\n   first created).

For example, if one person is not going to a particular instance of a regularly scheduled event, in iCalendar you would have to duplicate the entire event in the override.
