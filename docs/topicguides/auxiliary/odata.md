# OData

## Overview

[OData](https://www.odata.org/) or *Open Data Protocol* <!--is the love child of SAP and Microsoft. It--> allows compliant software, for example Excel on Windows, Salesforce, Power BI, to read and potentially write REST data.

OData doesn't use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) but its own definition format, which is a mix on JSON, XML, and dot-notation. We tested with Salesforce and Microsoft Excel, and we'd love to hear what you are using.
