# ODATA

[ODATA](https://www.odata.org/) is the love child of SAP and Microsoft. It allows compliant software (like MS-Excel on Windows, Salesforce, PowerBI etc.) to read and potentially write REST data.

ODATA doesn't use [JSON Schema](#) but its own definition format, a mix on JSON, XML and dot-notation.

We tested with Salesforce and MS-Excel, we'd love to hear what you are using.
