# Identity Provider (IdP)

DRAPI has a dual use function. It can **be** your [OICD](#) compliant Identity Provider **and** is can be configured to accept users authenticated with an external IdP like [Keycloak](#), [Okta](#) or [Microsoft Entra ID](#) (the system formerly known as Azure Active Directory).

In theory _any_ [OICD](#) compliant Identity Provider should be usable with DRAPI. If you tried one, [let us know the results](https://discord.com/invite/jmRHpDRnH4)
