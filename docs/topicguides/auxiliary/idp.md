# Identity Provider (IdP)

## Overview

The Domino REST API serves a dual function. It can act as your own [OIDC](../../references/security/authentication.md#oidc)-compliant Identity Provider, and it can be configured to accept authentication from external Identity Providers such as [Keycloak](../../howto/IdP/configuringKeycloak.md), Okta, or [Microsoft Entra ID](../../howto/IdP/configuringAD.md) (formerly Azure Active Directory).

In theory, any OIDC-compliant Identity Provider should be usable with Domino REST API. If you tried one, [let us know the results](https://discord.com/invite/jmRHpDRnH4).

## How-to guides

See the [Identity Provider](../../howto/IdP/index.md) topic page for a list of how-to guides for configuring IdPs.
