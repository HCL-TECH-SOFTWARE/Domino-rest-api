# Form modes

Form Modes are the enhanced security measures provided by [The Barbican](barbican.md). They allow to specify which document items are available for read and write operations based on a formula result. E.g. `@IsMember(Approvers; @UserName)` would make the mode available when the current user is listed in the `Approvers` item.
